This project focuses on providing phishing simulations for enterprise cybersecurity, with the purpose to enhance phishing methodologies used by organizations to simulate phishing attacks for training and testing purposes. The project focuses on different types of phishing threats ranging from different levels of difficulty based on the number of phishing attributes. 

 These templates are desinged to help organizations assess their susceptibility to phishing threats and train their employees to recognize and respond to phishing attempts.

The primary objective of this community-driven project is to create advanced techniques and resources that elevate the quality and realism of phishing simulations. By doing so, this can enable organizations to better prepare for real-world phishing threats and bolster their cybersecurity posture.
