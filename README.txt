This project focuses on providing phishing simulations for enterprise cybersecurity, to enhance phishing methodologies used by organizations to simulate phishing attacks for training and testing purposes. The project focuses on different types of phishing threats ranging from different levels of difficulty based on the number of phishing attributes. 

These templates help organizations assess their susceptibility to phishing threats and train employees to recognize and respond to phishing attempts.

The primary objective of this community-driven project is to create advanced techniques and resources that elevate the quality and realism of phishing simulations. Doing so can enable organizations to better prepare for real-world phishing threats and bolster their cybersecurity posture.
